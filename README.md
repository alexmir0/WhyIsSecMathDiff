ABOUT THE DATA SET
---------------------------
This data set served for the research: Why Is Secondary School Mathematics Difficult to Learn? From the Perspectives of In-Service Teachers and Cognitive Load Theory, authored by Àlex Miró (corresponding), Marc Alier, Ouhao Chen, Javier Mora, and Juan C. Castro-Alonso, in 2024.

The data set comprises a set of N = 11 interviews with secondary school mathematics teachers. Data is available in both .txt and .pdf formats.

The data set is coded in Catalan and Spanish, as those were the mother-tongue languages of the interviewed teachers. Among the data set, the researcher questions and interventions are coded after the symbol ‘R’ (researcher) and the participants answers are coded after the symbol ‘PXX’ (participant), where XX is the number of the participant.
